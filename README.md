# QuickAdd-for-Todoist
Effortlessly add tasks to your Todoist Inbox using just your voice with Alexa!

This skill utilizes Todoist’s natural language processing to allow you to add tasks effortlessly. Simply say, 'Alexa, tell QuickAdd to add [task],' and it will default to today's date in your Inbox. For tasks needing a specific due date, just include it after the task name.

Manage your to-do list hands-free while focusing on your productivity, not your planning. Just say the task and, optionally, when it’s due, and Alexa handles the rest. Perfect for busy individuals who need to organize their tasks quickly and efficiently!

Get started by saying, "Alexa, tell QuickAdd to add..."

Note: You may use both "Alexa, tell QuickAdd" and "Alexa, ask QuickAdd." This invocation format is different than the native Todoist integration was and is specified by Amazon to ensure smooth operation with Alexa. You might need a few tries to get used to this new way of adding tasks, but once you do, it’ll become second nature!

Pro Tip: For the shortest and easiest invocation say "Alexa, tell QuickAdd add [task]."
